    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I apply bioinformatics principles to public health and would like to continue in this avenue.
      This has led to exciting applications such as genomic epidemiology for bacterial pathogens.
education:
    - degree: PhD in Bioinformatics
      university: Georgia Institute of Technology
      time: 2010

        "Dissertation Title: Computational tools for molecular epidemiology and comparative genomics of Neisseria meningitidis"
    - degree: MS in Bioinformatics
      university: Georgia Institute of Technology
      time: 2005

experiences:
    - role: Senior bioinformatician
      time: 2014 - present
      company: DFWED, CDC
      details: |
        Although stationed in a team in EDLB, much of my work affects the division.
        * Facilitating interagency whole genome sequencing standards and analysis working group. This is a working group under the Genomics Food Safety collaboration (Gen-FS) between CDC, FDA, USDA, and NCBI. Determination of fact-based thresholds for whole genome sequencing to aid in the missions of CDC, FDA, USDA, and NCBI. Creation of whole genome sequencing benchmark datasets. Creation of a data download script. Datasets and script published in Timme et al 2017. I am senior author. I have also reached out to other labs at CDC including the Legionella lab to help contribute datasets. We meet once a month, and I facilitate the calls and record notes for the group.
        * Facilitating international workgroup under the Global Microbial Identifier (GMI). My workgroup (workgroup 3) focuses on data analytics. Benchmark datasets from Gen-FS have been donated to this group and we have collected datasets from international partners.
        * Advisor for GIGte, the monthly division-wide workshop in bioinformatics
        * Member of MCT-DART
        * In this role, I won an FIA to purchase a node in the SciComp cluster which we named Spaceball1. Although it costs $80k, it will save money long-term because no one will need to buy individual workstations. It is also more powerful than all or most individual computers at CDC right now.
        * Member of MCT SIAG
    - role: Senior bioinformatician
      time: 2015 - present
      company: BioMe, EDLB
      details: |
        * Supervisor Dr. Heather Carleton; acting team leads 2020-present: Drs. A. Jo Williams and Andrew Huang
        * Comparing cgMLST methods on the command line (ChewBBACA, etc)
        * Creating an ONT assembly workflow with Curtis Kapsak
        * Creating a new metagenomics profiler with Henk Den Bakker called Sepia (He is the main developer)
        * Developing custom metagenomics database for the Kraken suite
        * Helped advise CFU bioinformatics when it was being created
        * Developing rapid WGS tree-making pipeline called Mashtree. Provide assistance to users at CDC, nationally, and worldwide.
        * Developing a genome sketches repository for rapid cluster detection using Mash, the HPC, and crontab
        * Continued development of SneakerNet for other platforms and workflows, e.g., Ion Torrent, metagenomics
        * Developing high-quality SNP pipeline called Lyve-SET at https://github.com/lskatz/Lyve-SET (Published in Frontiers). Seeking feedback from bioinformaticians, PulseNet, epidemiologists across my division at CDC.
        * Maintaining hardware for EDLB
        * Supervising technical working group, for teaching ourselves bioinformatics techniques. This group is called the Genome Interest Group, Technical (GIGte, "giggity").
        * Founding member of the CDC-wide bioinformatics group BITCOP
        * Experience with data from Illumina, 454, Ion Torrent, Oxford Nanopore, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), Sanger

          * This workspace represents a new generation of international microbial bioinformaticians, with direct links to peers in all international major public health services, public health institutions, and affiliated universities.
          * I developed a code of conduct for the forum, which describes actions not permitted, and actions that the administrators can take when there is a violation.
          * The purpose is strictly not a help desk but is a place to get help directly from the source, e.g., understanding undocumented workflows or putting forth ideas directly with the author of a software package.
